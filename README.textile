h1. Infinispan Configuration

h2. Overview

This project is intended to help me explore the Infinispan Programmatic Configuration API to further research embedded servers, clustering, replication, eviction policies, etc.

h2. Usage

From the root of the project run:

bc. mvn clean install

Then open two shells and run the following in the first:

bc. JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true ./start-node0

...and in the second:

bc. JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true ./start-node1

Now you can type a message in the node1 shell when prompted, and it'll appear in the node0 shell in a few seconds.

I have not determined how to simply disable IPv6 in JGroups, so you might want to add the JAVA_OPTS entry to your @.bash_profile@.
