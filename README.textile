h1. Infinispan Configuration

h2. Overview

This project is intended to help me explore the Infinispan Programmatic Configuration API to further research embedded servers, clustering, replication, eviction policies, etc.

h2. Usage

From the root of the project run:

bc. mvn clean install

The @start@ script should help you get going. The syntax is:

bc. ./start cluster-name:String node_id:Integer

Then open two shells and run the following in the first:

bc. JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true ./start mycluster 0

...and in the second:

bc. JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true ./start mycluster 1

Now you can type a message in the _node1_ shell when prompted, and it'll appear in the _node0_ shell in a few seconds.

I have not determined how to simply disable IPv6 in JGroups, so you might want to add the @JAVA_OPTS@ entry to your @.bash_profile@.

h2. Todo

* Configure multiple caches, with and without LIRS eviction
* Ensure other machines don't join a named cluster
